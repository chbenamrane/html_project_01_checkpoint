      <h1>Evolving from Design to Development</h1>

      <p>
        With a strong background in graphic design and motion graphics, I have
        spent years crafting visual identities and digital content. My journey
        led me to become a Communication & Advertising Manager in a major TV
        manufacturing company, where I oversee branding, marketing strategies,
        and creative direction. Alongside this, my passion for web technologies
        grew, pushing me to master front-end and full-stack development with
        Next.js. Today, I blend design expertise with technical skills to build
        modern, engaging web applications.

      <p>
        Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve also developed strong public speaking and
        presentation skills, sharing ideas at conferences and company meetings.
        This experience has sharpened my ability to communicate clearly and
        effectively, whether in person or through digital platforms. These
        skills play a key role in my approach to both communication management
        and web development.
